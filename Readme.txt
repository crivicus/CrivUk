This is my dotnet 5 personal site implementation.

The idea is to create a webserver project that can be used to serve several sites while also acting as a base implementation for other programming ideas, features and tasks.

I am building it to be easy to pull down and test with anywhere while simultaneously allowing a variety of database types and server operating systems.

At the core will be a Content management system that can serve multiple sites with authorization and encryption built in.

This is my personal application of the base code used to build a site or set of sites of my own design and use.

If you want to download the project to have a go yourself you will need an appsettings.json file with the following:

{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "CheckNotConsentNeeded": "false"
}

and an appsettings-custom.json with this in (for testing purposes Password of the PasswordHash is "UserPassword"):

{
  "InitialConfig":"true",
  "Protector":"test.protector",
  "TestUser": {
    "UserName": "test@criv.uk",
    "Email": "test@criv.uk",
    "PhoneNumber": "0000000000",
    "NormalizedUserName": "TEST@CRIV.UK",
    "NormalizedEmail": "TEST@CRIV.UK",
    "PasswordHash": "AQAAAAEAACcQAAAAEH42gxSffx6QDd0SiDfk4fHzyvzYxWM39N6THgmwZ384co4FXqPKM7ywXPodVBev9A==",
    "UserType": 1
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "server=127.0.0.1;user=admin;password=password;persistsecurityinfo=True;port=1433;database=serverdb"
  },
  "PrimaryCertificate": {
    "location": "test1.pfx",
    "password": "test1pass1"
  },
  "BackupCertificate": {
    "location": "test2.pfx",
    "password": "test2pass1"
  }
}

or in other words to personalise:

{
  "InitialConfig": "true",
  "Protector": "YOUR.PROTECTOR.NAME",
  "TestUser": {
    "UserName": "your-username",
    "Email": "your@email.com",
    "PhoneNumber": "YOURNUMBER",
    "NormalizedUserName": "YOUR-USERNAME",
    "NormalizedEmail": "YOUR@EMAIL.COM",
    "PasswordHash": "ENCRYPTEDPASSWORDHASH",
    "UserType": 1
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "ENCRYPTEDCONNECTIONSTRING"
    /*"DefaultConnection": "server=127.0.0.1;user=yourdbuser;password=yourdbpassword;persistsecurityinfo=True;port=yourport;database=yourdb"*/
  },
  "PrimaryCertificate": {
    "location": "ENCRYPTEDLOCATION",
    "password": "ENCRYPTEDPASSWORD"
  },
  "BackupCertificate": {
    "location": "ENCRYPTEDLOCATION",
    "password": "ENCRYPTEDPASSWORD"
  }
}
